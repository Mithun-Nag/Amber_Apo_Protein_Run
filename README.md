# üß™ Amber Apo Protein MD Run

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook workflow** for setting up and running a **fully solvated molecular dynamics simulation** of an apo protein using **Amber 24** and **AmberTools 25**.

## üìÇ Contents

- **Amber_Apo_Run.ipynb** ‚Äì End-to-end workflow for protein preparation, system solvation, minimization, equilibration, and production MD  is your main file

## üèóÔ∏è System Setup

Amber 24 and AmberTools 25 were used for all steps.

Although designed for **ACCRE (Vanderbilt University HPC cluster)**,  
the workflow can be easily adapted to other HPC clusters or even a local AMBER installation.  

**Important:**  
- On ACCRE, the notebook loads the required Amber modules automatically.  
- On other systems, adjust the module load lines to match your environment.  
- If modules are not available, you can source Amber manually at the top of the notebook:  

!source /sb/apps/amber22/amber.sh



**NOTE**
Large output files from minimization and production stages have been removed ‚Äî  
this notebook is provided as a **template and reproducible workflow** for setting up and running your own simulations.

## üèÉ Minimization, Equilibration & Production

The notebook sets up and runs **multi-stage minimization** (restrained ‚Üí unrestrained).

NVT & NPT **equilibration** phases stabilize temperature and density.

Production MD is automated using a **Perl driver script** (`production.pl`) which loops over multiple 100ns chunks

Edit production.pl in the scripts according to need if requried to run for a longer time.
